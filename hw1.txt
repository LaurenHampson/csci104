 		Answers: 3

 	Part b: When cloning a Git repo, which of the following should you avoid?

 		Answers: 1, 2

 	Part c: Provide the appropriate git command to perorm the following operations
	 	
	 	1. Stage an untracked file to be committed. The (hypothetical) file is called 'hw1q2b.cpp'.

	 		Command: git add hw1q2b.cpp

		2. Display the details of the last three commits in the repository.
			

			Command: git log/p/3 

	Part d: Let's say you staged three files to be committed. Then, you ran the following cocmmand: git commit,  what will git do?

		Answer: This will launch your choice code eitor that was chosen during configuration.  This will alow you to enter the commit messages for each of the three files.

	Part e: What is the full command to re-clone your private CSCI104 repo to your VM? Assume you are in an appropriate folder

		Answer: 
			git clone git@github.com:usc-csci104-spring2018/hw-lhampson.git

Problem 3:

Problem 4: 

	1.  The output is

		1
		2
		3
		4
		5

		CODE TRACE FOR EXPLANATION


		funcA([1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , 5)

			int *a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
			size = 5

			funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 4)
				min = 0, max = 4, mid - 2

				funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 2)
					min = 0, max = 2, mid = 1

					funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 1)
						min = 0, max = 1, mid = 0

						funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 0)

							prints a[0] which is 1, and then prints a new line

						funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1, 1)
							prints a[1] which is 2, and then prints a new line

					funcB ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2, 2)
						prints a[2] which is 3, and then prints a new line

				funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 4)
					min = 3, max = 4, mid = 3

					funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 3)
						prints a[3] which is 4, and then prints a new line

					funcB([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4, 4)
						prints a[4] which is 5, and then prints a new line

				Code terminates once al recursive calls have been complete, final output is:
				1
				2
				3
				4
				5




	2. funcB will fail to terminate on any input values where the min value is greater than the max input

		funcB will always terminate for the other input values because the function will always increment and decrement the min and max values in a way that it will eventually reach the if statement where min == max.

	3. when funcB(a, min, max) is called, the function traces through the input, and then as it back traces, prints the elements out on one line at a time.  The recursion causes it to reach the first element first as it calls funcB on a smaller interval each time.
